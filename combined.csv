We believe that the most effective way to provide our students with a meaningful education is through project-based learning, in which students work in groups on projects that are important and relevant to their lives. Students will engage in learning experiences that will challenge them to think creatively, push them to behave independently and motivate them to grow socially. Technology and the humanities will be integrated across the curriculum.","Roundtable Review of student projects, Advisory, Internships, College Now, Arts, Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC), Robotics","Japanese, Spanish","English Language and Composition, Spanish Language and Culture",0,0,"Anime, Art Residencies, Chess, Dance Productions, Dance Team, History, Japanese, Morris Academy Mentoring, Movies, Museum Trips, National Honor Society/Arista, Robotics, Saturday Workshops, School Newspaper, Science, Slam Poetry, Talent Shows, Theater, Theater/Performance Arts, Tutoring in Math","Baseball, Basketball & JV Basketball, Bowling, Volleyball","Basketball, Cross Country, Softball, Volleyball",0,"Boys Baseball, Volleyball; Girls Softball; Girls and Boys Basketball",0,Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,Hostos Community College,"ArtsConnection, Theatre Development Fund (TDF)",Hope For New York (HFNY),McGraw-Hill Companies,JP Morgan Chase,0,"Three-week summer Learning Bridge Program offered to incoming freshmen (one high school credit earned upon successful completion of program), For additional information about our Mentor Internship Program please visit our website at www.morrisacademymentors.org",0,8:15 AM,3:30 PM,This school will provide students with disabilities the supports and services indicated on their IEPs.,ESL,Functionally Accessible,1,Priority to Bronx students or residents who attend an information session,Then to New York City residents who attend an information session,Then to Bronx students or residents,Then to New York City residents,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1110 Boston Road

We have received awards for our work in this rebuilding. Our students not only get their core academic courses, but can also commit to one of six career academies. With millions of dollars in scholarships earned by our seniors each year, internships for students starting freshman year and students moving on to prestigious universities like Fordham, NYU, St. John’s and Penn State, the question shouldn't be, 'Why should I attend Truman?' but rather, 'Why would I go anywhere else?'
